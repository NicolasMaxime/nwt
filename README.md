An angular project called LOS (by us) made for the New Web Technologies' lesson, by Nicolas Jessel.

## Running the client :
Clone the repository and then go in.
Run `Yarn install` to install all the d√©pendencies
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

The client need to be paired with a back end server : https://github.com/NicolasMaxime/nwt_back

Maybe correcting one or two bugs ?
